# To-Do List Project

This web application allows users to input tasks that they would like to post onto their to-do list. This web application also allows the user to remove tasks as they are completed as well as clearing all to-do list tasks when needed.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Optimizations

I would add a feature that allows the user to place a checkmark beside each task that was completed on the to-do list as well as a line running through to-do list tasks that were not completed that day.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned how to append the to-do list to ensure that each tasks submitted was added directly underneath the other.
